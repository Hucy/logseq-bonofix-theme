## About typography

Document mode in logseq hides all bullets while leave indentation space there, and with large spacing between blocks. 

It seems to be a trend in websites that large margin space is designed to mesh out grid, and designer's blogs tends to use sparse typography to be more fashionable. It's may be the influce of modern graphic design in poster or campaign layout. At most of time, large space is a good tool to make contrast and focusing. It also brings a good visual experience for publishing. However, from my point of view, it's not as much suitable for note-taking. Compared to published documents, the sentences in notes is often much more short without strict logical coherence. Large spacing will make information too sparse. In this theme, I make the headings more compact and content more compact to each other.

Meanwhile, there are classical line height sets in article typography. Take line height 1.5em (or padding 0.5em) as standard, the larger text the less line height multiples. Academic design will make the multiples arithmetic sequence or fibonacci sequence. In Logseq, the doc mode can be much more complex. Each block has it's own margin space, and the horizontal indentations also make the page seem messy. In this mode, I often give up bullet indentation and flatten my content. Then I notice that the space between headings and body is hard to control.

## About markdown and note taking

Markdown is an awesome format for publishing. You can easily organize your global style. However, it's not good enough for note taking. A published document should be well structured and easy to read, while notes are not always well organized, they're more flexible. Treat markdown as an input method but not file format might be a better choice for note taking. **In fact, the markdown files in logseq is not just file format, it's a human readable database**. Some people may think they use markdown format to be compatible with other apps. However, with more and more features involved, logseq markdown files are becoming harder to read. That's note taking. From other point of view, there is no standard for note taking elements and corresponding syntax.
