## Screenshots

The style is strongly inspired by [logseq-bujo-theme](https://github.com/PiotrSss/logseq-bujo-theme ) and [Notion](https://notion.so). The code is mainly based on bujo theme, and you may find the style really notion-like.

- Mobile: More stable scrolling experience

- No online fonts to work perfectly offline (for Google fonts service is not available in some area such as China)

## Bug on Logseq Desktop Version & Untested platform

 The Code block width of Desktop version is slightly different from modern browser (Chrome and Safari are tested), which might lead to code block overflow. For most cases it works well. If you do care about it, use `custom-desktop.css` file.

The stylesheet has been tested on Safari(iOS), Chrome(macOS) and Logseq Canary Desktop application(macOS).  If you find the code block still overflow the screen on other devices, do use `custom-desktop.css` which  provides more margin space on the right side of code block.
